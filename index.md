# Home of r00t3r's Cyber Security and Machine Learning Adventures

This blog contains indices all my adventures in Cyber Security and Machine Learning. I will go through things like the different thought process in different scenarios.
### LEARNING PATH : 
When you learn something by yourself, like by reading this blog, or by any other you have to overcome your obstacles yourself. There is no one with you to give you the exact path. You scrape the web, search for free/paid materials, try yourself etc... this way you are not only learning the content you searched for, at the same time **you are learning how to learn**. Few things I would like to mention here are :
* We have our different learning frequencies, it is proportional to the rate at which you catch concepts, things you already know and your aptitude for the thing you are trying to learn! You can try all you want but if your's and mine frequency don't match much then the learning process can be cumbersome. 
* When start learning the basics, you will get almost all the important and non-important concepts ( although every concept is important : **knowledge never goes to waste** ) at one place, but when you are an intermediate/advanced learner ( you are actually in the league ), then it is very hard to get resources that offer you everything at one place. Each and every other blog/book/some other material will give you things that no other material contains. 

Keep the above points in mind while following this blog or any other. I try my best to explain things, if you are unable to get hold of a concept you can ping me on **[telegram](https://telegram.me/sarcasticnerd)** or on **discord : @r00t3r-god#7120**, I will try to reply as soon as possible!

### ABOUT ME : 
I am a student. I love the art of learning, reading thick books, writing articles on what I know ( "**knowledge spread is knowledge increased - popular saying in INDIA**" ). I program in C/C++ and almost all of the posts you will see will be based on C++. I am also interesed in making my own games using graphics renderers like Vulkan & OpenGL from scratch. I know very beginner stuffs in OpenGL like how to draw a triangle, a cube and move it. So, you might expect things realated to those topics present on this too!
***I am a proud INDIAN.***

> BEING A BEGINNER AND STAYING A BEGINNER ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS - ME (-;-)
